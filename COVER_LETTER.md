Mr Bird

My name is Daniel Gonzalez Adarve, I am originally from Colombia and have been living in Australia since 2014. Pretty soon to become an Australian citizen, which I'm very proud of.

I have over 14 years of experience using different technologies, and methodologies in every stage of the software development process. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on developing web and mobile applications. This is a very interesting area which is always evolving and you are always forced to learn something new which is all very appealing to me. Although I must confess, lately I have been picking an interest in UX, CX, and design. I believe it helps developers to write better solutions, see the problem from a different angle other than a technical one, resulting in a solution that just works for all stakeholders.

In my journey as a developer, I've had the opportunity to be involved in a variety of projects, all sorts of API integrations, building information systems from scratch, websites, & apps. Not only as a developer, but also a project manager, lead developer and even managing networks and IT infrastructure. I'm very familiar with Agile methodologies and in a more technical side of things, I have experience building full-stack web applications and RESTful API's using languages such as PHP, Javascript, Ruby, and query languages as MySQL, MongoDB, and lately GraphQL and modern web development techniques using bundlers.

I have a strong understanding of fundamental CS concepts like OOP and MVC Architecture.

In eCommerce I have been involved in a few Shopify projects, using liquid and integrating the Shopify API with vue.js front-ends, as well as other platforms such as Woocommerce and Magento.

- [BusyBar](https://busybar.co/) (Custom Shopify Slate Theme)
- [SightSupply](https://www.sightsupply.com/) (PHP, Woocommerce, Shopify Integration)
- [MonkeyMarket](https://www.monkeymarket.com/) (VTEX)

Other eCommerce, brochure-like' websites I have built are:

- [JL King](https://www.jlking.com.au/)
- [Apex Steel](https://www.apexsteel.com.au/)

And if you are interested in all other non eCommerce work... I have built plenty of CraftCMS and Custom Wordpress websites using [Roots Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)

In terms of Ruby on Rails, I have worked in a few projects which are no longer online but you can see here, [Threadmeup.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150802133252/https://www.threadmeup.com/) & [HuddlePass](https://web.archive.org/web/20140123090426/http://www.huddlepass.com/)

I would be very excited about the opportunity to work at Disco Labs since it represents a change of scenario from what I have been doing and especially because I would be able to apply all my previous work experience and become an eCommerce specialist.

I hope this wasn't too long to read and while I probably missed a bunch of details about my experience I want to thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

***Daniel Gonzalez Adarve***
